# BandScrambler
Takes all the song lyrics of an artist it can find and scrambles it into a jumbled mess of a file. Sometimes has the potential to create something interesting.

Please note: it's not the most well thought out or "finished" code. The scrambling algorithm is kind of lacking; I couldn't be botherered to fix it. If anyone wants to contribrute let me know.
